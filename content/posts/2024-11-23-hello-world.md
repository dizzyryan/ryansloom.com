This is my personal (academic) webpage.<!--more--> As a CS student, I feel that I should have my own personal site — for academic use as well as for future employment.  

The main function of this page is to showcase my work on GitHub, since it isn't exactly PDF-friendly 😅. 

This was originally forked (then detached) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). However, I found that the style wasn't for me, and using Jekyll felt like a bit of a hassle…  

Thanks to AI, I can now generate the whole website with ease 🎉. This might not be the best way to go about it, but it's definitely a lot of fun 😎.  

You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/dizzyryan/ryansloom.com). If you find any issues, feel free to AI it, since I used AI to generate most of the site — and I believe you’ll figure it out if you want to make your own web…  

Nothing else to say for now. Let me wrap it up here.
