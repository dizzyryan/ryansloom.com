Well, I’ve got another idea for posting... something?<!--more-->

I thought, why not write a review or comment about the course I took? So here I am with this post. Details like the grading scheme might not be entirely accurate since they can change over time, but I think giving you a glimpse of what the course looks like could be fun.

## Before you start
Thanks to CUHK, we have quite a lot of courses to take, especially in general education. It depends on how you see it, but I think they are quite educational (at least for the courses I’ve taken so far, though it might be better if they weren’t credit-bearing).

With that said, I’ve categorized the following just for your information, in case you’re not familiar with what I’m talking about.

+ Major Required
    + Faculty Package (9)
    + Foundation Course (16)
    + Major Required (27)
    + Major Elective (17)
    + Major Final Year Project (6)
    + Free Elective (9)
+ University Core
    + Language (8 + 5)
    + Foundation GE * (6 + 7)
    + College GE (6)
    + Understanding China/Hong Kong (1 + 1)
    + Digital Literacy and Computational Thinking (3)
    + Physical Education 

(*) depending on the faculty, the requirements may vary. For me, I need to take courses from UGEA, UGEC, and UGED.

## Year 1 Fall

My memories of the courses I've taken this term are a bit vague, so I’m not able to provide detailed reviews. However, overall, the courses were quite manageable—mostly serving as a recap of math concepts, I suppose.
